# Grade-Computation-Tool
This is a simple Flask web application that allows users to input their Preliminary grades and computes the required Midterm and Final grades to pass a certain grade.

How to use:
- Input user's preliminary grade in a range of 0 to 20 only. (Preliminary grade: 20%)
- It will display the required midterm and final grades based on the user's submitted preliminary grade to achieve a passing grade of 75%.

How to run:
- Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
- Install the Flask library (pip install Flask).
- Run the application with python canciotool.py.
- Click the web browser (http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
- Enter your Preliminary grade and see the required Midterm and Final grades to pass.

Take note:
- Make sure the browser allows connections to localhost to see the web interface.
- To stop the Flask server, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the server is running.
